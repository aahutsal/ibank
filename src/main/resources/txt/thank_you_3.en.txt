Dear $userName, thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback regarding your stay at our hotel. Firstly, we are pleased to learn that the big hotel area and availability of sunbeds was up to your satisfaction. On another note, we were concerned to note that room, service and food did not meet your expectations. This should not have been the case, and we are sorry for any inconvenience encountered. I have shared your review with the hotel Senior Team for their attention and immediate corrective measures. Please rest assured that we are taking your feedback very seriously, and are continually working to improve our overall services and facilities. Thank you once again, and hope to welcome you back to the $actor on your next visit to Hurghada!
